# malignant_tumor_probability
**Octave machine learning**<br>
In this project logistic regression in machine learning is used to predict with what probability the tumor is malignanat.
In Logistic Regression sigmoid function is used to generate a probability.
![sigmiod function](https://github.com/parasgulati/malignant_tumor_probability/blob/master/sigmoid%20graph.png)    
as easily visible from the graph, it outputs a positve value between 0 and 1.
